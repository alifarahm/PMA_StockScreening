# PMA_StockScreening
This code is for stock screening among SP500 symbols based on Pivot Moving Average strategies.
If in a 30-min time frame, PMA(14) > PMA(30) > PMA (50) and each PMA is above its previous period figure, there is an indication
that in the short term an upward trend has started.
Combined with above indicator, if in daily time frame PMA(14) > PMA(30) > PMA (50) then short term movement is in line with
medium term trend.
